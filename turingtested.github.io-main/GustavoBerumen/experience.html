      <h4 style="text-align: center">I am a user experience researcher. My PhD work was focused on creating smart versions of consumer-packaged goods using data as a resource for design. I have over ten years of experience conducting human-centred research in academic and industry settings in the fields of experimental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. I've completed internships at Johns Hopkins University, Philips, and Unilever, and conducted studies in Mexico, the USA, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. I've also co-authored several papers, and have contributed to various industry projects.</h4>
