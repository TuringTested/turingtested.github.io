<p><a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction:</b> All species undergo gradual change over time, but in the fossil record we find evidence of some changes that are particularly striking. This website is dedicated to some of these so-called <i>transitional fossils</i>.</p>

<p><a name="warning1"></a><b>Warning 1:</b> The images are only artist's conceptions and might contain errors; so I keep a page with <a href="pics.html">links to photos or diagrams of the fossils themselves</a>.</p>

<p><a name="warning2"></a><b>Warning 2:</b> When a fossil is called "transitional" between two types of animal, that means it shows some of the traits of both, but it does not mean it links those animals by direct descent. Evolution is a branching process - by which we mean that species often <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation">split in two</a>. Therefore:

<p class="indent red nobottom">"Because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process that produces a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, <b>it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other</b>."</p>

<p class="notop" style="margin-right:6em; text-align:right;"> &mdash; Rusty Cashman / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_fossil">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>In short, transitional fossils are best thought of as being close relatives of the species which actually link two groups. They may have lived at the same time as those actual links, <b>or they may not have</b> (this confuses many people). As long as these problems are borne in mind, transitional fossils give a rough indication of what evolutionary changes were occurring. But don't be misled into thinking that fossils are the only evidence for evolution. They're not even the strongest evidence for evolution.</p>

<p>Sometimes called "the only transition which matters", this mustn't be thought of as a transition from chimps to humans, but rather, as a transition from the-common-ancestor-of-chimps-and-humans to humans. Chimps themselves have had time to evolve and change since we parted ways, and so "the ancestor we last shared probably differed substantially from any extant African ape" (White <i>et al</i>, 2009).</p>

Fish - tetrapods</h2>

<p class="notop">
<i>Most fish-like at the top. Images and diagrams of the fossils <a href="pics.html#tetrapods">here</a>.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> This group of fossils were thought to be roughly contemporary with the transition onto land. However, recently tracks of a four-footed animal were discovered in marine sediments firmly dated at 397 million years old (Niedzwiedzki <i>et al</i>, 2010). If that animal was a genuine tetrapod, then creatures like <i>Tiktaalik</i> may have been "late-surviving relics" exhibiting transitional features that actually evolved somewhat earlier.</p>

<p>In short, these are not the actual ancestors of modern land animals; but they are <a href="#warning2">related</a> to the actual ancestors, and so they do show us the sort of creature that evolved during the great move onto land.</p>

<dt><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusthenopteron">Eusthenopteron</a></i>
<span class="date">~385 million years ago</span>
	<dd>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic_zone">pelagic</a> fish, <i>Eusthenopteron</i> is probably representative of the group from which tetrapods evolved. It had a tetrapod-like skull and spine (Prothero, 2007).
<dt><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panderichthys">Panderichthys</a></i>
<span class="date">~385 mya</span>
	<dd><i>Panderichthys</i> had a tetrapod-like braincase and tetrapod-like teeth, and had also lost its dorsal and anal fins (Prothero, 2007).
<dt><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik">Tiktaalik</a></i>
<span class="date">~375 mya</span>
	<dd>Though still a water-dweller, <i>Tiktaalik</i> had fins that were halfway towards being feet, and ears capable of hearing in air or water (Prothero, 2007). It was capable of crawling around in very shallow water, and it had a neck, unlike fish but like tetrapods (Coyne, 2009).
<dt><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventastega">Ventastega</a></i>
<span class="date">~365 mya</span>
	<dd>The bones of <i>Ventastega</i> are intermediate between <i>Tiktaalik</i> and <i>Acanthostega</i> (Ahlberg <i>et al</i>, 2008). Sadly, the fossil is incomplete and we can't see its fins/feet.
<dt><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthostega">Acanthostega</a></i>
<span class="date">~365 mya</span>
	<dd>Possessing four definite legs, <i>Acanthostega</i> was presumably capable of movement over land (Coyne, 2009), though the legs were still better suited for crawling along the bottom of the water (Prothero, 2007). Its tail was still adapted for propulsion through water, and it still had gills (Ridley, 2004).
<dt><i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyostega">Ichthyostega</a></i>
<span class="date">~365 mya</span>
	<dd>Slightly more like a land animal, <i>Ichthyostega</i> had powerful shoulders implying it did indeed use its legs to move over land, at least sometimes (Clack, 2005). Even now, the skull still closely resembled that of <i>Eusthenopteron</i> (Futuyma, 2005).
<dt><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederpes">Pederpes</a></i>
<span class="date">~350 mya</span>
	<dd>The foot of <i>Pederpes</i> "has characteristics that distinguish it from the paddle-like feet of the Devonian forms [i.e. the above animals] and resembles the feet of later, more terrestrially adapted Carboniferous forms" (Clack, 2002).
</dl>

<p>These creatures were related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungfish">lungfish</a> of their time, and almost certainly all had lungs themselves.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to think that the first tetrapods moving on land needed limbs capable of bearing their full weight; legs sprawled to the side would be enough to move about with. One thing the above fossils seem to show is that legs first evolved for crawling over the bottom of the water; only later did their use on land become paramount.</p>

<dt><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchiornis">Anchiornis</a></i>
<span class="date">~155 million years ago</span>
	<dd>Although many feathered dinosaurs are known, <i>Anchiornis</i> is the first to be found that probably predates <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. The feathers were "not obviously flight-adapted" (Hu <i>et al</i>, 2009).
<dt><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a></i>
<span class="date">~145 mya</span>
	<dd>The famous <i>Archaeopteryx</i> had feathers and was probably capable of at least gliding, but it also had dinosaur-like teeth, claws, and a long bony tail. Its skeleton was "almost identical to that of some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropoda">theropod</a> dinosaurs" (Coyne, 2009). Precisely how closely related it is to the main line of bird evolution remains the subject of controversy (Xu <i>et al</i>, 2011).
<dt><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confuciusornis">Confuciusornis</a></i>
<span class="date">~125 mya</span>
	<dd><i>Confuciusornis</i> had a bird-like tail and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygostyle">pygostyle</a>, which is a feature of modern birds. It retained dinosaur-like claws (Prothero, 2007). It had strong shoulder bones, but was probably not capable of true flapping flight (Senter, 2006). It may have glided. It is the earliest known bird with a toothless beak, but other lineages continued to have teeth for a long time.
<dt><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinornis">Sinornis</a></i>
<span class="date">~110 mya?</span>
	<dd><i>Sinornis</i> "still had teeth, an unfused <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsus</a>, and an unfused pelvis" (Prothero, 2007) but resembled modern birds in other ways, with reduced vertebrae, a flexible wishbone, a shoulder joint adapted for flying, and hand bones fused into a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpometacarpus">carpometacarpus</a> (Prothero, 2007).
<dt><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorona">Vorona</a></i>
<span class="date">~80 mya?</span>
	<dd>The legs of <i>Vorona</i> are all that we have (Benton, 2005), but they show a combination of bird characteristics and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniraptora">maniraptoran</a> (dinosaur) characteristics (Forster <i>et al</i>, 1996).

<span class="date">~80 mya</span>
	<dd>A strong flyer, <i>Ichthyornis</i> was very nearly a modern bird (Prothero, 2007), and yet it still had teeth.
</dl>

<p>As birds evolved from dinosaurs, and required feathers to fly, the existance of non-flying, feathered dinosaurs is a prediction of evolution. Happily, we have now discovered a significant number of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathered_dinosaurs">such dinosaurs</a>, one of which, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mei_long"><i>Mei long</i></a>, was even found curled-up in a remarkably bird-like sleeping position (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://www.amnh.org/science/papers/sleeping.php">picture here</a>).</p>

<p>The first feathered dinosaurs found were more recent than <i>Archaeopteryx</i> &mdash; feathered dinosaurs didn't die out as soon as birds evolved &mdash; but we now have <i>Anchiornis</i>, which has shown that feathered dinosaurs did indeed exist before <i>Archaeopteryx</i>.</p>

<p>One will occasionally encounter vague suggestions that birds evolved from (non-dinosaur) reptiles. John Ruben and colleagues are the main supporters of this idea, but it remains very much a minority view. Michael Benton (who literally wrote the book on vertebrate paleontology) considers the controversy artificially extended by the popular media's obsession with giving both sides "equal time", even though the dinosaur-bird view is supported by the vast majority of working palaeontologists (Benton, 2005). The University of California Museum of Paleontology has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/avians.html">reasonable overview</a> of the dinosaur-bird relationship.</p>

</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the group that gave rise to mammals were not true reptiles (though they were closely related). Therefore, there is no transition from reptiles to mammals, but rather from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapsid">synapsids</a> to mammals. However, the terms <i>mammal-like reptiles</i> and <i>reptile-like mammals</i> are still sometimes used for these transitional fossils.</p>

	<dd>More mammal-like, especially in how it held its limbs: closer to its body like modern mammals, rather than sprawled to the side like <i>Dimetrodon</i> (Prothero, 2007). It still had a great many "primitive" features, such as ribs in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar">lumbar</a> area (Prothero, 2007).

	<dd>Had the beginning of a secondary palate in its skull (Prothero, 2007); in modern mammals, this allows eating and breathing at the same time, and is a sign of a more active lifestyle (Ridley, 2004). Its more advanced skull also allowed it to chew its food; and indeed it had premolars and molars with which to do so (Prothero, 2007). The skeleton was not yet fully mammal-like, but it had lost those lumbar ribs.

	<dd>Perhaps the actual ancestor, <i>Pakicetus</i> was probably semi-aquatic; like <i>Indohyus</i>, it had dense bones for ballast (Thewissen <i>et al</i>, 2009). Its body was "wolf-like" but the skull had eye sockets adapted for looking upwards, presumably at objects floating above it (Thewissen <i>et al</i>, 2009). Although initially known from just a skull, many more bones were found later (Thewissen <i>et al</i>, 2001).

	<dd>With a streamlined, elongated skull and reduced limbs, <i>Ambulocetus</i> probably spent most of its time in shallow water. Its reduced limbs meant it could only waddle on land (Coyne, 2009). It resembled a crocodile in some ways.

On land it would struggle, moving "somewhat like a modern eared seal or sea lion" (Gingerich <i>et al</i>, 2001). Its teeth were simpler than its predecessors (Futuyma, 2005), a trend that continued to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=dolphin%20teeth">the present</a>.

However this is disputed; the "foetus" might just be a partially digested meal (Thewissen and McLellan, 2009).

	<dd>The blowhole in <i>Aetiocetus</i> is about halfway to its position in modern whales on top of the head. <i>Aetiocetus</i> also represents the transition from toothed whales to the filter-feeding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen">baleen</a> whales, being similar to baleen whales in most respects, but possessing teeth (Van Valen, 1968).

<p>Whales evolved relatively quickly. As Coyne (2009) explains, "adapting to life at sea did not require the evolution of any brand-new features - only modifications of old ones". Thewissen <i>et al</i> (2009) give a good overview of whale evolution, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://www.springerlink.com/content/whn1654v74t64301/fulltext.pdf">freely available</a>.</p>

<p><b>Beware:</b> There's a commonly reproduced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://www.edwardtbabinski.us/whales/whales-graph.jpg">image</a> <!-- or http://scepticon.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/whales-graph.jpg --> from a popular science book (Zimmer, 1998) that depicts two dolphin-like creatures, <i>Takracetus</i> and <i>Gaviacetus</i> (always misspelled <i>Gaviocetus</i>) as having short hind limbs. However, the first fossils found were basically skulls plus a few vertebrae (Gingerich <i>et al</i>, 1995), and I've been unable to find any discussion of more complete fossils. Zimmer's book is explicit that some of the depictions are based on very incomplete fossils, so I don't regard that image as authoritative. Happily, we have much better fossils for the species I mention in my list.</p>

<p>With horse evolution, it's particularly important to bear the <a href="#warning2">warning</a> at the top in mind: we have many fossils, and the known family tree is very bushy, not a straight line. At one time, 13 different <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus">genera</a> of horses existed simultaneously (Raven <i>et al</i>, 2008). Regardless, there are definite trends over time towards larger body size; larger, ridged teeth suitable for grazing; longer limbs; and reduction of side toes (Raven <i>et al</i>, 2008). These trends were not absolute, however.</p>

<p>There was a section on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosaur">ichthyosaurs</a> (a group now extinct) on this site, but I wasn't entirely satisfied with it. We don't yet have anything as good as <i>Tiktaalik</i> or <i>Ambulocetus</i> for ichthyosaurs. Still, fossils like <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331113428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixosaurus">Mixosaurus</a></i> can be considered transitional between early eel-shaped ichthyosaurs, and later dolphin-shaped species.</p>
